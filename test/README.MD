# List. Any way you like.

Based on CodeWars 2kyu Kata: [Link to challenge](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f7a040a5b820c684000046)

JavaScript Arrays can only represent lists of finite length. Your job is to implement the List class, which must be able to represent both finite and infinite lists. It must support the class and instance methods specified below. Methods must not have side effects ( mutating any argument would be a side effect ).

The internal representation of List is completely free. With great power, however, comes great responsibility: you need to supply adequate laziness to support infinite lists yourself. E.g. [ infinite elements ].map( function ) or [ infinite elements ].append( [ (in)finite elements ] ) should return a new [ infinite elements ].

## Class methods
`List.empty`, `.iterate(fn,x)`, `.repeat(x)`, `.cycle(xs)`, `.replicate(n,x)`, `.fromList(xs)`

where fn is a function, xs is a list, x is an element (a value) and n is a number.

## Instance methods
`list.head()`, `.tail()`, `.init()`, `.last()`, `.length()`, `.toList()`, `.get(i)`, `.nil()`, `.take(n)`, `.drop(n)`, `.cons(x)`, `.append(xs)`, `.slice(i,j)`, `.map(fn)`, `.filter(fn)`, `.reverse()`, `.concat()`, `.concatMap(fn)`, `.zipWith(fn,xs)`, `.foldr(fn,x)`, `.foldl(fn,x)`, `.scanr(fn,x)`, `.scanl(fn,x)`, `.elem(x)`, `.elemIndex(x)`, `.find(fn)`, `.findIndex(fn)`, `.any(fn)`, `.all(fn)`, `.the()`

where fn is a function, xs is a list, x is an element (a value), i,j are indices and n is a number (a sort of index).

## More class methods
You will also need to implement some use cases of infinite lists.

> List.PRIME: an infinite list of all prime numbers ([ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, .. ] )
You might use primes = filterPrime [2..] where filterPrime (p:xs) = p : filterPrime [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p /= 0] from haskell.org. It can be written quite elegantly using List. (Don't worry too much about efficiency for this.)

> List.FIB: an infinite list of Fibonacci (0,1) numbers ( [ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, .. ] )
You might use fib = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fib (tail fib). (Again, elegance over efficiency.)

> arctan(x) can be written as an infinite sum 0 + x^1/1 - x^3/3 + x^5/5 - x^7/7 ..
Ï€ is equal to 4 * ( arctan(1/2) + arctan(1/3) )

>List.PI: an infinite list of increasing numbers of terms (taken pairwise) of this infinite sum
( [ 0, 4*(1/2+1/3), 4*(1/2+1/3 - 1/8/3-1/27/3), 4*(1/2+1/3 - 1/8/3-1/27/3 + 1/32/5+1/243/5), .. ] )
This one is actually quite efficient ! even though it can converge faster still with other constants. But these look nice. :P
notes

Unlike in Haskell, the head, tail, init and last of an empty list are defined. Also, the is defined for all lists ( and can be determined, except in case of an infinite list of all equal elements ).
Diverging results and list values at out-of-bounds indices are undefined ( not necessarily undefined ! ).
take and drop have defined results for out-of-bounds arguments, but slice does not.
Undefined results may result in any value or action.
All test inputs are valid and should result in a defined result.

## Class methods
- [x] List.empty => an (or the) empty list ( must not require () )
- [x] List.iterate(fn,x) => an infinite list of successive applications of fn to x
- [x] List.repeat(x) => an infinite list, every element of which is x
- [x] List.cycle(xs) => an infinite list of repetitions of xs ( equals xs if xs is infinite )
- [x] List.replicate(n,x) => a finite list of length n, every element of which is x
- [x] List.fromList(xs) => xs converted to a list ( an Array must be a valid xs )
- [x] List.PRIME, List.FIB, List.PI => ( must not require () )

## Instance methods
- [x] list.head() => the first element of list, or undefined for empty list
- [x] list.tail() => list without its first element, or an empty list for empty list
- [x] list.init() => list without its last element, or an empty list for empty list ( equals list if list is infinite )
- [x] list.last() => the last element of list, or undefined for empty list ( diverges for infinite list )
- [x] list.length() => the length of list ( diverges for infinite list )
- [x] list.toList() => list converted to an Array ( diverges for infinite list )
- [x] list.get(i) => the element of list at index i
- [x] list.nil() => true for empty list, false otherwise ( null in Haskell )
- [x] list.take(n) => the first (at most) n elements of list ( n may be negative or greater than list.length() )

- [x] list.filter(fn) => only the elements of list for which fn holds
- [x] list.reverse() => list in reverse order ( diverges for infinite list )

- [ ] list.concatMap(fn) => list transformed by fn, then flattened
- [ ] list.zipWith(fn,xs) => map, but with two lists ( fn will normally be a binary function )
- [ ] list.foldr(fn,x) => right-associative reduction of list to a single value ( [x1,x2,..,xn].foldr(fn,z) = fn( x1, fn( x2, .. fn( xn, z ) ) ) ) ( foldr should only recursively evaluate necessary fn arguments, as to return a valid value from a nullary or unary fn even if list is infinite ) ( not quite .reduceRight() in JavaScript )
- [ ] list.foldl(fn,x) => left-associative reduction of list to a single value ( [x1,x2,..,xn].foldl(fn,z) = fn( .. fn( fn( z, x1 ), x2 ) .., xn ) ) ( diverges for infinite list ) ( .reduce() in JavaScript )

- [ ] list.scanl(fn,x) => left-associative incremental reduction of list to a list ( [x1,x2,..,xn].scanl(fn,z) = [ z, fn( z, x1 ), fn( fn( z, x1 ), x2 ), .., fn( .., xn ) ] )
- [x] list.elem(x) => true if list contains x, false otherwise ( possibly diverges for infinite list ) ( .includes() in JavaScript )
- [x] list.elemIndex(x) => index of x in list, or -1 if list does not contain x ( possibly diverges for infinite list ) ( .indexOf() in JavaScript )

- [x] list.the() => any element of list if all elements of list are equal, undefined otherwise ( possibly diverges for infinite list )
